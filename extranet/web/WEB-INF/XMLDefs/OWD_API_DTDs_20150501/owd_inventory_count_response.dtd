Defaults to 14 days.				FACILITY_COUNT element attributes				facility_code = alphanumeric code for facility. See OWD_FACILITY_LIST_REQUEST for facility details corresponding to the code value				All other attributes have the same meaning as for COUNT, but are only valid for the specific facility indicated				Formulas:				Quantity available for new orders: quantity_on_hand		Quantity available for new orders, after subtracting units assigned to active, unreleased orders: quantity_on_hand - backorder_count		Quantity belonging to all unreleased (on hold and active backorder) orders: backorder_count		Quantity belonging to all orders in active backorder status: backorder_count - on_hold_count		Quantity belonging to all orders in on hold status: on_hold_count				The on_hold_count value is always part of the backorder_count value - that is, an item with 3 on hand, 2 in backorder count		and 1 in on_hold_count means that 1 unit is in active backorder status and 1 unit is in on hold status.				Please see the OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_REQUEST DTD for details on requesting particular attributes (since 1.1)		--><!ELEMENT OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_RESPONSE (COUNT+)>                    <!ELEMENT COUNT (FACILITY_COUNT+)><!ATTLIST COUNT	  part_reference		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  quantity_on_hand		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  description			CDATA	#IMPLIED	  is_active				(1|0)	#IMPLIED	  backorder_count		CDATA	#IMPLIED	  backorder_order_count	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  expected_count		CDATA	#IMPLIED	  expected_asn_count	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  expected_asn_next_date	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  on_hold_count			CDATA	#IMPLIED>  <!ATTLIST FACILITY_COUNT	  facility_code			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  quantity_on_hand		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  expected_count		CDATA	#IMPLIED	  expected_asn_count	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  expected_asn_next_date	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  on_hold_count			CDATA	#IMPLIED	  backorder_count		CDATA	#IMPLIED	  backorder_order_count	CDATA	#IMPLIED	  > <!-- 1.0 EXAMPLE         <OWD_API_RESPONSE results="SUCCESS">	<OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_RESPONSE>		<COUNT part_reference="asasd87JDJ" quantity_on_hand="23" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd37JDJ1" quantity_on_hand="21" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd47JDJ2" quantity_on_hand="344" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd57JDJ3" quantity_on_hand="12" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd67JDJ4" quantity_on_hand="0" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd77JDJ5" quantity_on_hand="3" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd97JDJ6" quantity_on_hand="9" />		<COUNT part_reference="asasd07JDJ7" quantity_on_hand="64" />	</OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_RESPONSE></OWD_API_RESPONSE>1.1+ EXAMPLE         This item has 23 units in stock and no unreleased orders pending<OWD_API_RESPONSE results="SUCCESS">	<OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_RESPONSE>		<COUNT part_reference="asasd87JDJ" quantity_on_hand="23" description="A valuable item" is_active="1" backorder_count="0" />	</OWD_INVENTORY_COUNT_RESPONSE></OWD_API_RESPONSE>	 1.2+ EXAMPLE         This item has 2 units in stock and 1 unit in an order with status "on hold".
