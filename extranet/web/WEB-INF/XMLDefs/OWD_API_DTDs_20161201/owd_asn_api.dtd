<!-- OWD_ASN_STATUS_REQUEST description

	This request returns an OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE if successful, which can contain multiple
	descriptions of existing ASN and receive records. See OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE for response details.

	An empty status request returns details for all asn records (this list may be very large and slow to return).

	The returned list may be restricted by adding one or more FILTER elements to the status request. Each
	FILTER element contains two subelements, FILTER_TYPE and FILTER_VALUE.

	The value of the TYPE element must be one of the strings listed in the table below (case-sensitive).
	The associated VALUE element may be a number, a date or a string value depending on the TYPE value.
	Multiple FILTER elements can be included in the request - all FILTERs will be combined in a logical
	AND. All returned results will have satisfied all FILTER requirements provided.

	FILTER_TYPE option                  FILTER_VALUE contents
	================================================================
	reference             	String value. Returns asns whose client asn reference value matches the provided value.
    containsSku             String value. Returns all asns containing the indicated SKU
    status         			String value. Must be one of UNRECEIVED, PARTIALRECEIPT, CANCELLED or COMPLETE.
    receivedOn              String value. Matches asns with a receive completed on the indicated date. Value should be in YYYYMMDD format.
    receivedSince			String value. Matches asns with a receive completed on or after the indicated date. Value should be in YYYYMMDD format.
    hasUnreleasedReceives   Integer value. Zero to restrict results to asns with no unreleased receives, 1 to restrict results to asns with at least one unreleased receive
    owdReference        	Integer value. Returns all items with a quantity_available value below the indicated value
    poReference             String value. Returns asns whose PO reference value matches the provided value.
    shipper                 String value. Returns asns whose shipper value matches the provided value.
    groupName           	String value. Returns only items with a matching groupname value

<!-- OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE returns zero or more OWD_ASN_STATUS elements, one per returned subscription.

   The initial COUNT subelement notes how many OWD_ASN_STATUS elements are being returned in this response. 0 is a valid value
   if the requested criteria for a OWD_ASN_STATUS_REQUEST matched no records, or after a successful OWD_ASN_DELETE_REQUEST.

   OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE is the response type for asn creation, update, deletion and search requests

	Notes on each subelement of the OWD_ASN_STATUS element are below:
	
-->

<!ELEMENT COUNT (#PCDATA)><!--Number of OWD_ASN_STATUS elements being returned in this response-->


<!ELEMENT REFERENCE (#PCDATA)><!--Your reference value for this ASN record. Not checked for uniqueness. Optional.-->
<!ELEMENT PO_REFERENCE (#PCDATA)><!--Another reference value for this ASN record. Normally used to help locate ASN for a shipment by comparing to PO number on paperwork accompanying incoming shipment. Not checked for uniqueness. Optional.-->

<!ELEMENT SHIPPER (#PCDATA)><!--Name of supplier that will be sending the shipment. Optional.-->

<!ELEMENT CARRIER (#PCDATA)><!--Type of carrier delivering package must be one of Unknown, USPS, UPS, FedEx, or LTL Truck. Optional.-->
<!ELEMENT AUTORELEASE (#PCDATA)><!--A value of "1" directs OWD to make inventory received on this ASN immediately available
                              to fill new orders when the receive is completed. Any other value, or omitting this attribute, will require a
                              manual confirmation or an asn update call to make any received inventory available to ship after the receive is done. Required during asn creation.-->
<!ELEMENT CARTONS (#PCDATA)><!--Integer quantity of shipping cartons expected with this shipment. Optional.-->
<!ELEMENT PALLETS (#PCDATA)><!--Integer quantity of pallets expected with this shipment. Optional.-->
<!ELEMENT GROUPNAME (#PCDATA)><!--String reference value for arbitrary grouping of ASNs and receives by identifier. Optional. 50 character maximum.-->
<!ELEMENT FACILITY_CODE (#PCDATA)><!--String reference value for the physical facility where the shipment will arrive. Optional. Current valid codes are 'DC1' (SD) and 'DC6' (CA).
									  If not present during ASN creation, the default facility for the client account will be used automatically. -->
<!ELEMENT STATUS (#PCDATA)><!-- General status of this asn record. In OWD_ASN_STATUS, must be one of UNRECEIVED, PARTIALRECEIPT, CANCELLED, or COMPLETE. CANCELLED indicates
                                that the asn had a period of inactivity exceeding two months and was automatically cancelled by the system. This element can be used
                                in an update request to force the status to COMPLETE or UNRECEIVED from the other states. See OWD_ASN_UPDATE_REQUEST -->




<!--  Each asn can have zero or more RECEIVE elements. Each RECEIVE element represents a completed receive event against the parent asn record. Each receive

<!-- OWD_ASN_UPDATE_REQUEST description

	This request updates an item record and returns an OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE if successful. See OWD_ASN_STATUS_RESPONSE for response details.

	The returned records reflect the state of the system after the requested updates have been applied.

	This call allows updating all available fields of the asn record, including the ASN_ITEM records. This call does respect the
	TESTING flag and will roll back any database changes after sending a response if TESTING is set to TRUE.

	Each OWD_ASN_UPDATE_REQUEST sent represents a request to update one item record. The id attribute value of OWD_ASN_UPDATE_REQUEST provides
	the unique identifier for the item to update. This id value is the same returned in ASN_STATUS records.

	The rest of the OWD_ASN_UPDATE subelements are the fields to update. You may include any number of the available fields to update. Please see
	the examples for clarity (below). Update requests cannot be made and will be rejected while a new receive is being processed against the asn
	(see the receive_active attribute of the OWD_ASN_STATUS element).

	The ASNITEMS/ASNITEM elements are special in that if you provide any ASNITEM elements to update or add, all existing asn items
	will be deleted and only the list provided in your update request will exist after the update is complete. ASNITEM lists cannot be modified after
	the first receive is completed against the parent asn record.

	For example, if an item has 2 ASNITEMs in it now and you want to add a new item to it, your update request must include
	both the old and new ASNITEM information in your update request. Examples are provided below.

	The STATUS element can be used to update the overall status of an asn record in two ways:

	1. If the current status of an asn is anything other than COMPLETE, you can pass a value of COMPLETE int the STATUS element to change the asn status to COMPLETE
	2. If the current status of an asn is COMPLETE or CANCELLED, you can change it to UNRECEIVED by passing that value in the STATUS element, but only if no
	   receives are completed or active for the asn
