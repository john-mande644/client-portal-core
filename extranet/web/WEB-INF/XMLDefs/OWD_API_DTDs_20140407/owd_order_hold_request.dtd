<!-- OWD_ORDER_HOLD_REQUEST element attributes
	clientOrderId 		= OWD-assigned order identifier. If client does not track OWD order IDs, they can use their
				  own order reference as supplied with the order, but the request will only succeed if the order reference
				  is unique among all non-voided orders for the client. OWD-assigned order identifiers are guaranteed to be unique.

	The OWD_ORDER_HOLD_REQUEST request returns an OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE if successful. The
	response will show an order status of "ON HOLD". If this call is made against an order that is already on hold, the response will indicate success.
	
	Requests to place orders on hold can only be fulfilled if the order has not yet begun the physical picking process. 
	Requests to cancel released orders should be directed to the OWD account manager via
	phone or email. Orders may begin picking within 30 minutes of release to the warehouse.
