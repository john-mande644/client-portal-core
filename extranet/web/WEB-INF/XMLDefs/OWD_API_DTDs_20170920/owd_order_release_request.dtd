<!-- OWD_ORDER_RELEASE_REQUEST element attributes

	clientOrderId = OWD-assigned order identifier. If client does not track OWD order IDs, they can use their
				    own order reference as supplied with the order, but the request will only succeed if the order reference
				    is unique among all non-voided orders for the client. OWD-assigned order identifiers are guaranteed to be unique.

	partialShipAllowed = Optional flag to allow partial release of order. Must be passed with a value of "TRUE" to be recognized. If set,
	                    the order will be released with all available units of all items. An active backorder will be created for any
	                    remaining units requested.

	The OWD_ORDER_RELEASE_REQUEST request returns an OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE if successful. The
	response will show an order status of "WAREHOUSE".

	Requests to release orders can only be fulfilled if the order has not yet been released to the warehouse
	for shipping and is not void. Orders released will be subject to further verifications of shippability, payment checks, etc.
	these checks normally occur within 2-5 minutes after the initial release.

	There are no OWD fees associated with releasing qualifying orders via this interface.
