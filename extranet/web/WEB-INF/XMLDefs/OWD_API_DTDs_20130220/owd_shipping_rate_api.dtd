<!-- OWD_SHIPPING_RATE_REQUEST description

	This request returns an OWD_SHIPPING_RATE_RESPONSE if successful. See OWD_SHIPPING_RATE_RESPONSE below for response details.

	This call accepts a mailing address, a list of item SKUs and quantities, and a list of OWD ship method codes. Each request
	causes the address to be validated (US addresses only) and corrected or standardized if possible. The updated address is then
	rated against each indicated ship method, using a predicted package size and weight based on the item list provided.
	
	The response document returns an ADDRESS and RATES element. The ADDRESS->RESULTS element indicates whether or not the ADDRESS
	could be validated and standardized. If correction was successful, the value of RESULTS will be CORRECTED, otherwise it will 
	be UNCORRECTED. The rest of the ADDRESS subelements either provide the corrected address or echo the original address values
	if validation was not successful. Regardless of whether correction was successful, the rest of the values returned in the 
	ADDRESS element will be the values that were used to rate the shipment. 
	
	The RATES response contains a RATE element for each ship method requested. Each RATE contains the OWD ship method code, the
	name of the ship method (suitable to display to customers), and either a COST or ERROR element. If the ship method was rated
	successfully, the COST element is present - otherwise the appropriate error message is displayed in the ERROR element. 

	Note that you may use international addresses and ship method codes, but address validation will not be provided for non-US 
	addresses. The process of determining rates will provide some validation of international postal code patterns, etc., but
	will not correct invalid addresses.
	
	Notes on each defined element are below:
