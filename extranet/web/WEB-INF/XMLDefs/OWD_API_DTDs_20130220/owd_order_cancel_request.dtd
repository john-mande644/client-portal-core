If client does not track OWD order IDs, they can use their				  own order reference as supplied with the order, but the request will only succeed if the order reference				  is unique among all non-voided orders for the client. OWD-assigned order identifiers are guaranteed to be unique.	The OWD_ORDER_CANCEL_REQUEST request returns an OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE if successful. The	response will show an order status of "VOID".		Requests to cancel orders can only be fulfilled if the order has not yet been released to the warehouse	for shipping. Requests to cancel released orders should be directed to the OWD account manager via	phone or email. Orders may ship within 30 minutes of release to the warehouse.		There are no OWD fees associated with cancelling qualifying orders via this interface.--><!ELEMENT OWD_ORDER_CANCEL_REQUEST EMPTY><!ATTLIST OWD_ORDER_CANCEL_REQUEST          clientOrderId       		CDATA   #REQUIRED> 	           <!-- EXAMPLE<OWD_API_REQUEST	api_version="1.0"          		client_id="1234"          		client_authorization="12938462"          		testing="FALSE" >	<OWD_ORDER_CANCEL_REQUEST clientOrderId="N1WEDrer" /></OWD_API_REQUEST>-->
