If "CSV", this element contains a CSVDATA element. Echoed from request.	report_type	= The type of report requested. Currently only the "RETURNS" report is available. Echoed from request.		OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE encompasses either a single CSVDATA element or zero or more semantic elements. If the XML format is requested	and there is no data available that matches the report parameters, the OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE element will contain nothing. If the	CSV format is requested in the same situation, the CSVDATA element will be returned with the header attribute filled in, but the	body of the CSVDATA element will be empty.		The table below lists the types of elements returned for each possible report_type attribute value:		report_type value          Element type contained within OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE	============================================================================	RETURNS                    RETURN (zero or more)	INVENTORY_ACTIVITIES	   INVENTORY_ACTIVITY (zero or more)		The following descriptions apply to each of the possible elements and subelements that can be returned within the 	OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE node:				CSVDATA element attributes			header	= Comma-delimited list of names for each column of the data returned in the body of the element. Column			  names are comma-delimited, without any end-of-line character, and are not individually quoted (see			  example at bottom of this document). The column names are the same as the attribute names for the equivalent			  semantic elements of the XML format.		The CSVDATA element contains in its body a PCDATA value that consists of a comma-delimited dataset matching the column names	and ordering listed in the header attribute. This dataset is comma delimited, with individual string values quoted with ASCII	double-quote characters. Each line is terminated with a line feed character (ASCII 10). There is no end of file character.		RETURN element attributes		owd_order_id	= The numeric order identifier generated and used by OWD. 		client_order_id	= The order identifier provided by the client for the order, if any, otherwise an empty string.		bill_last_name 	= The last name of the customer as recorded in the original order, if any, otherwise an empty string.		bill_zip 	= The zip or postal code of the customer as recorded in the original order, if any, otherwise an empty string.		receive_date 	= The date the return was processed, in YYYYMMDD format.		notes 		= Free text notes on the processing of the return as provided by warehouse personnel. May be empty.		Each RETURN element represents a single receiving event, i.e., there can be more than one RETURN element for a given order.		Each RETURN element contains one or more RETURNED_ITEM elements.		RETURNED_ITEM attributes		sku		= The client's SKU identifying the item		description	= The SKU description (as listed in database)		return_reason	= The indicated reason for the return (free text) when available		received	= The number of items of this SKU received		accepted	= The number of items of those received that have been returned to inventory		damaged		= The number of items unsaleable due to damage apparent during inspection		opened		= The number of items unsaleable because the packaging was opened		For each RETURNED_ITEM element, the total of the opened+damaged+accepted values will equal the received value. There is one 	RETURNED_ITEM element for each unique SKU returned.	INVENTORY_ACTIVITY element attributes		sku				= The client's SKU identifying the item 		received 		= The number of items of this SKU received through shipments from client or suppliers		adjustments 	= Miscellaneous adjustments to the inventory level of this SKU due to miscounts, accident, theft, etc.		returns 		= The number of items of this SKU returned by the customer or the carrier		shipped 		= The number of items of this SKU that were shipped out of the distribution facility		current 		= The number of items in stock and available to new orders at the time the report is generated			Each INVENTORY_ACTIVITY element represents a summary activity report for a single SKU. The report will only include SKUs where at least on	of the returned activity values is not zero.--><!ELEMENT OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE (RETURN+|CSVDATA)><!ATTLIST OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE	  format		(XML|CSV)	#REQUIRED	  report_type		(RETURN|INVENTORY_ACTIVITY)	#REQUIRED>                     <!ELEMENT CSVDATA (#PCDATA)><!ATTLIST CSVDATA	  header		CDATA	#REQUIRED>      <!ELEMENT RETURN (RETURNED_ITEM+)><!ATTLIST RETURN	  owd_order_id		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  client_order_id	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  bill_last_name	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  bill_zip		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  receive_date		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  notes			CDATA	#REQUIRED> <!ELEMENT RETURNED_ITEM EMPTY><!ATTLIST RETURNED_ITEM	  sku		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  description	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  return_reason	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  received	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  accepted	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  damaged	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  opened	CDATA	#REQUIRED><!ELEMENT INVENTORY_ACTIVITY EMPTY><!ATTLIST INVENTORY_ACTIVITY	  sku		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  received	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  adjustments	CDATA	#REQUIRED	  returns		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  shipped		CDATA	#REQUIRED	  current		CDATA	#REQUIRED>	   <!-- EXAMPLE of "RETURNS" report data as XML         <OWD_API_RESPONSE results="SUCCESS">	<OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE format="XML" report_type="RETURNS">		<RETURN owd_order_id="asasd37JDJ" client_order_id="21" bill_last_name="" bill_zip="" receive_date="20010901" notes="">			<RETURNED_ITEM sku="asd-183" description="" received="1" accepted="0" damaged="1" opened="0" />		</RETURN>	</OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE></OWD_API_RESPONSE>	           --><!-- EXAMPLE of "RETURNS" report data as CSV         <OWD_API_RESPONSE results="SUCCESS">	<OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE format="CSV" report_type="RETURNS">		<CSVDATA header="owd_order_id,client_order_id,bill_last_name,bill_zip,receive_date,notes,sku,description,received,accepted,damaged,opened" ><![CDATA[12345,"321-da","Zucker","98032",20010801,"","asd-183","asd stuff",1,0,1,0]]		</CSVDATA>	</OWD_REPORT_RESPONSE></OWD_API_RESPONSE>	           -->
