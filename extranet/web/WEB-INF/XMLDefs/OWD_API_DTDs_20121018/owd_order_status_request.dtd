If client does not track OWD order IDs, they can use their				  own order reference as supplied with the order, but the request will only succeed if the order reference				  is unique among all non-voided orders for the client. This field or createdDate must be present.	summary         = if passed and set to "TRUE", the response will be an ORDER_SUMMARY_RESPONSE instead of the default ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE.				  See the owd_order_summary_response.dtd file for details.	createdDate		= Alternative to clientOrderId, provides date of order creation in OWD system. Status elements						will be returned for all matching orders. This field is ignored if the clientOrderId attribute is present.							prefixSearch        = "TRUE" or "FALSE", defaults to "FALSE". Supplying this attribute with a TRUE value	                      causes the system to search for all orders whose client order reference value begins 	                      with the string supplied in the clientOrderId attribute. Since multiple order records	                      may be found by such a search, the OWD_API_RESPONSE from this request may contain	                      multiple OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE elements.--><!ELEMENT OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST EMPTY><!ATTLIST OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST          clientOrderId       		CDATA             createdDate       		CDATA          summary                   (TRUE|FALSE)        "FALSE"          prefixSearch       		(TRUE|FALSE)		"FALSE"> <!-- EXAMPLE of request by createdDate<OWD_API_REQUEST	api_version="1.0"          		client_id="1234"          		client_authorization="12938462"          		testing="FALSE" >	<OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST createdDate="20050826">        </OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST></OWD_API_REQUEST>-->	           <!-- EXAMPLE of request by order reference<OWD_API_REQUEST	api_version="1.0"          		client_id="1234"          		client_authorization="12938462"          		testing="FALSE" >	<OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST clientOrderId="N1WEDrer">        </OWD_ORDER_STATUS_REQUEST></OWD_API_REQUEST>-->
