	order_reference		= Alphanumeric identifier for order as known to client system
	order_source		= Alphanumeric free text source identifier (e.g., fax, email, phone, web. etc.)

					BACKORDER=Backorder entire order until it can be completely filled
					PARTIALSHIP=Ship available items, backorder the rest

					NOBACKORDER=Reject the order; do not create a new order record (Default behavior)

	OWD_ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST returns an OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE element
	
	OWD_ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST also encompasses a single SHIPPING_INFO element

**NOTE ON SHIPPING TERMS***
        	This acct and terms elements can be used in a variety of ways to determine the exact billing method for shipping. 
        	They should only be used in cases where you need to override the default shipping billing method set up with OWD for your account.
        	
        	Here are the rules:
        	
        	1. If the SHIPPING_INFO.acct attribute is provided and the SHIPPING_INFO.terms
        	attribute is missing or set to 'SHIPPER', the shipment will be billed to the provided account number using third party billing.
        	
        	2. If the SHIPPING_INFO.terms are set to 'COLLECT' and a SHIPPING_INFO.acct number is provided, 
        	the shipment will be shipped 'Freight Collect' and billed to the provided account.
        	
        	3. If the SHIPPING_INFO.terms are set to 'COLLECT' and a SHIPPING_INFO.acct value is not provided, 
        	the shipment will be billed as 'Consignee Billing'.
        	
        	Also see the description for the  optional subelement 'THIRD_PARTY_SHIPPING'
        	
        	These billing methods are not appropriate for all carriers - for example, USPS has no shipper accounts. If you have any questions,
        	please contact us.

        	THIRD_PARTY_SHIPPER is used to provide a third party contact/address information for shipment billing by the carrier. If you
        	indicate that a third party shipping account should be used (via the SHIPPING_INFO.acct attribute) and set the SHIPPING_INFO.terms
        	attribute to SHIPPER and do not provide contact/address info for the account holder via this element, your 
        	address of record with OWD will be given to the carrier for billing purposes.
        	
        	If a shipping account reference is provided in SHIPPING_INFO and this element is present and populated, the address
        	information given here will be passed to the carrier for billing. In all other cases, this element will be ignored.
        	
        	In order to utilize this element in your request, the SHIPPING_INFO.acct attribute value must be present.

		part_reference		= alphanumeric item SKU (part reference) - must be unique across all client part references
					  (API v1.1) If the SKU contains a forward slash (/), only the portion of the part reference 
					  up to but not including the first forward slash found is read and used for this line item.
					  This function is provided to allow aliases to SKUs.

		 					  value is less than the actual stock level, the order will be handled as though the actual quantity was equal to the 
		 					  "requested" value and the standard backorder policy rule as requested will be applied to the order. Example: to 
		 					  force the packing slip and order record to show the backordered quantity without actually creating a backorder, set this attribute
		 					  to the proper value and set the backorder policy rule to IGNOREBACKORDER.
		line_number		= optional string (up to 50 chars) representing the identifier for this line to an external system. Normally used to report shipping status by line to external system.					  
		is_insert_item = if present with a value of "YES" (case-insensitive), this line item will be flagged to prevent it from shipping by itself. Used for inserts and similar items that should only be used when accompanying other items.

		The MESSAGE element is intended for gift orders - it is a gift message from the buyer to the addressee. It is ignored unless
		the is_gift attribute of the OWD_ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST element is "YES".
		
	
	OWD_ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST also encompasses zero or one COMMENTS elements
	
		The COMMENTS element is intended for special instructions for processing the order. It is free text.
