May be an empty string.	backorderOrderId 	= orderId attribute value for backorder derived from this order, if applicable	backorderedFromOrderId	= orderId attribute value for order from which this order was derived, if applicable	status			= overall status of order. Normal flow is: RECEIVED->WAREHOUSE->SHIPPING->SHIPPED. Inventory is committed upon receipt of order.	groupName			= Arbitrary group reference for this order as previously set. String, up to 50 characters.	stoppedAtStatus		= if order status is STOPPED or REVIEW, provides last status code of order before processing was halted	paymentStatus		= payment status of order - is CLIENTMANAGED unless OWD does payment processing	shipDateExpected	= if not shipped, this is the planned ship date. May change based on payment status, etc.	shipMethod			= the full official name of the currently selected ship method for the order (USPS Priority Mail, UPS Ground, etc.)	shipMethodCode		= the shipping method code for the currently selected ship method for the order (USPS Priority Mail, UPS Ground, etc.)	facilityRule		= API version 2.0+ only. Indicates the policy to apply to determine the facility to ship from. Can be set to a facility code value, e.g., "DC1" or "DC6" as					listed in OWD_FACILITY_LIST_RESPONSE, or one of two policy values:					CLOSEST = This will cause the order to be assigned to the closest facility to the shipping address.					SPLIT = Only valid if the backorder_rule value is PARTIALSHIP. This will cause all available items to be shipped from the closest facility, and remaining items to						     be shipped from the next closest facility that has stock. This may result in multiple shipments per						     order. If all facilities are out of stock, the remaining items will go on backorder (if allowed according						     to the backorder policy and will be shipped as inventory becomes available, regardless of facility, with a preference for 						     the geographically closest facility if multiple facilities have sufficient stock.						      	OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE also encompasses zero or more LINE elements.			LINE element attributes			clientSKU		= item SKU (part number) assigned by client		requested		= count of items of this SKU requested by this order		assigned		= count of items of this SKU assigned to this order from inventory (will be zero for orders on hold)		backordered		= count of items of this SKU that have been placed on backorder (will be zero for orders on hold)		line_number     = client-supplied reference value for this line item (from order creation or update)			OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE also encompasses zero or one SHIPMENT elements.		SHIPMENT element attributes			shipDate		= date order was shipped, if applicable 		shipVia		= carrier and ship type (example: USPS Priority Mail)		shipViaCode	= Shipping method code (see OWD_ORDER_CREATE_REQUEST for listing of codes and meanings)		Each SHIPMENT encompasses 1 or more PACKAGE elements.			PACKAGE element attributes			packageNumber		= ID for package - normally 1,2,3,4, etc. 		trackingNumber		= tracking number of package(s), if shipped and applicable.		ratedCost			= carrier book rate cost of shipment, in decimal US dollars.		weightLbs			= weight of package in decimal pounds.--><!ELEMENT OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE (SHIPMENT?, LINE?) ><!ATTLIST OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE          orderId       		CDATA   #REQUIRED          clientOrderId       		CDATA   #REQUIRED          backorderOrderId    		CDATA   #IMPLIED          backorderedFromOrderId	CDATA   #IMPLIED          status    			(STOPPED|          				REVIEW|          				BACKORDER|          				RECEIVED|          				WAREHOUSE|          				SHIPPING|          				SHIPPED|          				VOID)   #REQUIRED          stoppedAtStatus    		(RECEIVED|          				BACKORDER|          				WAREHOUSE|          				SHIPPING|          				SHIPPED)   #IMPLIED          paymentStatus			(CLIENTMANAGED|          				WAITINGCCAUTH|          				WAITINGCCCHARGE|          				CCREJECTED|          				CCREVIEW|          				WAITINGCK|          				PAID)   #REQUIRED           shipDateExpected    		CDATA   #IMPLIED          shipMethod				CDATA	#IMPLIED          shipMethodCode			CDATA   #IMPLIED          shipFromPolicy			CDATA   #IMPLIED> <!-- shipFromPolicy only present in API version 2.0+ --> <!ELEMENT SHIPMENT (PACKAGE+)><!ATTLIST SHIPMENT	  shipDate			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  shipVia			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  shipViaCode			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  shippedFromFacilityCode	CDATA #REQUIRED > <!-- shippedFromFacilityCode only present in API version 2.0+ -->	           <!ELEMENT PACKAGE EMPTY><!ATTLIST PACKAGE	  packageNumber			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  trackingNumber		CDATA	#IMPLIED	  ratedCost				CDATA	#IMPLIED	  weightLbs				CDATA	#IMPLIED><!ELEMENT LINE EMPTY><!ATTLIST LINE	  clientSKU			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  requested			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  assigned			CDATA	#REQUIRED	  backordered			CDATA	#REQUIRED><!-- Status code explanations (for attributes status and stoppedAtStatus)	STOPPED   = Order is on hold; usually waiting for payment (check paymentStatus and stoppedAtStatus attributes)	REVIEW    = Order has been queued for human review	BACKORDER = Order is a pending backorder	RECEIVED  = Order has been accepted, but not yet released to warehouse	WAREHOUSE = Order released to warehouse for picking	SHIPPING  = Order has been picked; waiting for manifesting	SHIPPED   = Order has been released to carrier	VOID      = Order has been voided--><!-- Status code explanations (for attribute paymentStatus)	CLIENTMANAGED   = Order payment processing performed by client, not One World 	WAITINGCCAUTH	= Order is waiting for CC authorization to be confirmed	WAITINGCCCHARGE	= Order is waiting for CC payment to be confirmed	CCREJECTED  	= CC payment information rejected by processor	CCREVIEW   	= CC payment information is queued for human review; usually needs voice authorization	WAITINGCK      	= Order is waiting for receipt of check/cash/MO payment	PAID		= Order has been paid in full--><!-- EXAMPLE<OWD_API_RESPONSE results="SUCCESS">	<OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE	orderId="0012345"					clientOrderId="N123AEweg"					status="SHIPPED"					paymentStatus="CLIENTMANAGED">		<LINE clientSKU="N123rsdER" requested="23" assigned="23" backordered="0">		</LINE>		<SHIPMENT shipDate="20000421" shipVia="USPS Priority Mail">			<PACKAGE packageNumber="1" trackingNumber="el100324482" ratedCost="3.23" weightLbs="1.48">			</PACKAGE>		</SHIPMENT>	</OWD_ORDER_STATUS_RESPONSE></OWD_API_RESPONSE>-->
